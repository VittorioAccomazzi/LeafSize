## Testing
- In order to run the test you'll need to install [node-canvas](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas) which details can be found [here](https://github.com/Automattic/node-canvas/wiki/Installation:-Mac-OS-X). In short for macOS you need to run the following `brew install pkg-config cairo pango libpng jpeg giflib librsvg` otherwise the installation of `node-canvas` will fail.
- In order to dump the images during testing for visual inspection, set the enviroment variable `DUMP` to `true` and then run the test on the shell using the normal npm command (`npm run test`)
